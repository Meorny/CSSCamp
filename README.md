## 📄 What is CSSCamp?

CSSCamp is a lightweight and powerful tool designed to help you create beautiful user interfaces without hassle. It is a CSS framework that makes styling websites easy and fast. You do not need deep knowledge of coding to use it.

With CSSCamp, you get a simple way to add ready-to-use styles to your web pages. It works well with HTML and helps your site look modern and clean. Whether you want buttons, forms, layout grids, or navigation menus, CSSCamp provides the components you need.

## 💻 System Requirements

## 🔧 Using CSSCamp in Your Project

If you want to create your own web page using CSSCamp, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a New HTML File

### 2. Include CSSCamp Styles

Copy this line into the `<head>` section of your HTML file to link the CSSCamp framework:

```

Replace `"path/to/csscamp.css"` with the actual path to the CSS file from the extracted folder.

### 3. Add Your Content

In the `<body>` of your file, write your page content using normal HTML tags. Use classes from CSSCamp to style elements like buttons, forms, or headings. For example:

```html
<button class="cc-btn-primary">Click me</button>
```

### 4. Open Your Page in a Browser
